# OnlyfansPriceScraper
This repository houses a Python script that employs Selenium for web scraping. The script extracts pricing details from specified profiles, allowing users to choose between English and Dutch via a command-line interface. It navigates through provided profile URLs, extracts price and limited offer information, and outputs the results to a CSV file.
